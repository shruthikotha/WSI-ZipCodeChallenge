Since real-world inputs for this test are likely to come from databases
and/or web services, I chose to focus on getting the functionality accurate
I've provided a simple maven module with a suite of tests to
demonstrate proper operation. Simply import the module into the editor of
your choosing and run the JUnit tests.
